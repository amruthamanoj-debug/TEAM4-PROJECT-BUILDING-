The Digital Queue &amp; Waiting-Time Management System is a React web app built by Team 4 during the TinkerHub CEAL session. It replaces paper tokens with digital tracking and live wait-time updates, reducing congestion and allowing users to monitor their status remotely. A modern solution for efficient, real-time queue management.
